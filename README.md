# Shopping With Logistic Regression

The jupyter notebook contained within this repository includes a detailed walkthrough of an effort to conduct meaningful predictive modeling using Logistic Regression. The data for this project included online user behavior of shoppers visiting an online retailer. The data included labels indicating whether or not a shopper executed a purchase. The intent was to predict whether or not a given shopper would ultimately transact given a shopping session on the company's website. 

A narrative was generated around the project where 'Amazon Inc.' had contracted with a fictitious consulting firm, JE Consulting (me), to perform data analysis and predicitive modeling for Amazon's online revenue operations team. The accompanying notebook walks the viewer through the steps and code used to perform the analysis 'requested' by Amazon Inc. 

Some of the project highlights include the following: 

- Feature scaling with SKlearn's Standard Scaler package
- Data rebalancing using the SMOTE method
- Classification modeling using Logistic Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning using SKlearn's GridsearchCV package
- ROC Curve analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis using the chosen model evaluation metric: precision score
